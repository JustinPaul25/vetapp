# Diarrhea Types Reference Guide

This document provides a reference guide for the different types of diarrhea symptoms that can be selected in the veterinary application. Each type has specific clinical meanings that can help in diagnosis.

## Diarrhea Types

### 1. **Diarrhea - Watery/Osmotic**
- **Description:** Extremely loose, watery stools
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Fatty meals
  - Lactose intolerance
  - Toxins
  - Infections (secretory diarrhea)
  - Enteritis
  - Viral infections (Parvovirus, Coronavirus)
  - Parasitic infections (Giardiasis, Coccidiosis)
  - Food allergies

### 2. **Diarrhea - Bloody (Red)**
- **Description:** Contains fresh, red blood
- **Possible Causes:**
  - **EMERGENCY SITUATION**
  - Fresh bleeding from large intestine
  - Colitis
  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  - Parvoviral Infection
  - Hookworm Infection
  - Foreign body injury
  - **Requires immediate veterinary attention**

### 3. **Diarrhea - Bloody (Black/Melena)**
- **Description:** Contains digested blood (appears black/dark)
- **Possible Causes:**
  - **EMERGENCY SITUATION**
  - Digested blood from upper GI tract
  - Gastritis
  - Gastric ulcers
  - Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus
  - Foreign body ingestion
  - Toxicosis/Poisoning
  - **Requires immediate veterinary attention**

### 4. **Diarrhea - Mucus-Filled**
- **Description:** Contains visible mucus, often semi-formed and urgent
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Large intestine inflammation (colitis)
  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  - Parasitic infestations
  - Bacterial infections
  - Colonic irritation

### 5. **Diarrhea - Fatty/Pale (Steatorrhea)**
- **Description:** Grayish, greasy stools from poor fat absorption
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Pancreatic issues (Pancreatitis, Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency)
  - Liver disease
  - Hepatitis
  - Malabsorption syndromes
  - Bile duct obstruction

### 6. **Diarrhea - Frequent/Urgent**
- **Description:** Small, frequent stools or puddles, often with straining
- **Possible Causes:**
  - Large bowel issues (colitis)
  - Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  - Parasitic infestations
  - Food allergies
  - Colonic irritation
  - Typical of large bowel dysfunction

## General Notes

- **General "Diarrhea"** symptom is also available for cases where the specific type is not identified or when documenting general diarrhea episodes.
- Bloody diarrhea (red or black) is an **emergency situation** that requires immediate veterinary attention.
- Multiple diarrhea types can be selected if the patient exhibits different characteristics during the episode or over time.
- These specific diarrhea types help improve the accuracy of disease prediction models by providing more detailed symptom information.
- The distinction between red and black blood helps localize the source of bleeding (large intestine vs. upper GI tract).

## Usage in the Application

These diarrhea types are available as selectable symptoms in:
- Prescription creation
- Disease management
- Patient examination records
- Machine learning disease prediction models

The detailed diarrhea type information helps the ML models make more accurate disease predictions by correlating specific stool characteristics with known disease patterns.

## Clinical Significance

- **Watery/Osmotic:** Often indicates secretory or osmotic causes, may lead to dehydration
- **Bloody (Red):** Indicates active bleeding in lower GI tract, requires immediate attention
- **Bloody (Black/Melena):** Indicates upper GI bleeding, digested blood, serious condition
- **Mucus-Filled:** Suggests colonic inflammation or irritation
- **Fatty/Pale (Steatorrhea):** Indicates malabsorption, often pancreatic or hepatic origin
- **Frequent/Urgent:** Suggests large bowel involvement, often inflammatory in nature
